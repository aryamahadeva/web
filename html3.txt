to start the student branch of ‘Computer Society of India’ – CSI, a professional body at

National level, in the year 2012, all the students in the department were enrolled as

student members. The College also obtained CSI Institutional Membership and most of

the staff members are Life Members of CSI. Department Library has been set up with
